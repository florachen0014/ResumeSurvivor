DATA &amp; ANALYTICS AT MARS PETCARE




The Mars Petcare Segment consists of five Divisions: Pet Nutrition, Royal Canin, Mars Veterinary Health N. America, Mars Veterinary Health International &amp; Diagnostics, and Kinship. Under this new organization of Petcare Product and Service brands, we launched our data strategy in 2018 with an objective to ""
Create a Better World for Pets by extending global leadership in Nutrition, Health and Services powered by data"".




With the breadth and scale of our Petcare businesses we have unique and unrivalled data assets. The potential to create benefits for pets and sustainable competitive advantage is huge and we need to seize this opportunity now.



Our data assets consist of a variety of sources: veterinary data including appointment and invoice details as well as the medical histories and diagnostic details this provides, breed and disease marker data from our DNA diagnostics business (Wisdom Health), location and activity tracking data from our Whistle business, and we have sales data, consumer data, and valuable information about retailers, veterinarians, breeders and shelters from our nutrition business. We also have third party data providing us with product purchasing insights and the potential to develop deeper and broader views into Petcare shopping through collaboration and D2C engagement.




MARS VETERINARY HEALTH &amp; DIAGNOSTICS: POWERED BY DATA




A division of the Petcare Group, Mars Veterinary Health and Diagnostics is a purpose led, mission drive business that generates more than $7 billion in annual revenue, with more than 65,000 associates, +2,500 animal hospitals around the world and the largest network of veterinary labs in North America. We operate a family of veterinary businesses – Banfield, VCA, BluePearl, AniCura, and Linnaeus and one focused on veterinary diagnostics -Antech-.



At Antech we are using artificial intelligence to disrupt diagnostics. In the past six months we have launched ground-breaking, innovative technologies such as RenalTech®, which is able to predict chronic kidney disease in cats up to two years before it's diagnosed as well as the first non-invasive diagnostic for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, which will help dogs recover faster by giving veterinarians an easy way to diagnose or rule out this complex disease. This focus on innovation and a clear strategy to accelerate international expansion is an unmatched opportunity to define the future of pet health.




WHY JOIN US?




This is a game-changing leadership role in our business, and more broadly in the world of Data &amp; Analytics. It is incredibly exciting for many different ways that the right candidates will truly be energized and passionate about.




Leading a totally new capability within our Division: opportunities with a relatively blank canvass, at a global scale in this space are rare. This is a unique chance to get this journey started, to set the direction, establish the ways of working and grow the talent


It is entrepreneurial, and it has the backing of a scale business with serious strategic ambition and leadership backing


The variety of data and spectrum of possibilities is immense and also unique. Most businesses have relatively narrow sector focus. Petcare is our scope and the data assets we can bring to bear are from genetics, medical records, activity tracking, nutrition consumption, shopping behavior, lifestyle, marketing response, digital behavior … across millions of individuals and many geographic markets. These assets together at scale have perhaps never been available like this anywhere else. This is a treasure-trove of data that will have your imagination racing. There are so many possibilities and having both a keen pioneering instinct as well as a focus on practical outcomes will be key to unlocking tangible benefits and value


We are truly purpose driven and consumer-centric. We are powering our business with data to create a better world for pets. We are aiming for outcomes that improve pets lives and ours as pet parents too. Yes, we are also focused on sustaining and growing our business, as our 5 principles show, we see this mutuality as fundamental to how we operate





HOW YOU'LL CREATE A BETTER WORLD FOR PETS




We are searching for two experienced Data &amp; Analytics leaders to drive divisional efforts to be ""Powered by Data"" in the Mars Veterinary Health division of Mars Petcare. One role will be focused on our Mars Vet Hospitals, and the other leading D&amp;A for our Diagnostics business, Antech. The D&amp;A leader will articulate the strategic opportunities for data analytics, to develop and deliver the roadmap of use cases from Science to Marketing, to develop the resources and upskill the businesses, and to drive the data strategy all as a connected part of the Petcare ecosystem.



Reporting into our CFO with a dual reporting responsibility to the Global Petcare Data &amp; Analytics leader, this role will engage stakeholders within Mars Veterinary Health to create and deliver the Data &amp; Analytics strategy, the role will also provide connectivity with other Divisions for broader Ecosystem impact and benefit creation.


Responsibilities include:




Lead the ""Powered By Data"" Strategy, roadmap and implementation for Mars Veterinary Health





Engage Mars Veterinary Health leadership to define the strategic priorities for ""Powered By Data"" – identifying where our Pet and Pet Owner data and analytics capabilities can drive new levels of pet benefits and/or business performance

Lead the development of Division data assets, privacy frameworks and data standards as part of the broader Petcare data strategy


Appoint a Data Director for the Division to lead this area under your guidance


Oversee the Division Data Strategy


Ensure effective data provision to the Ecosystem solution and return flows of ecosystem data to benefit Division systems, applications and users. Ensure changes are managed effectively


Oversee data access rights and rules, and the processes to ensure appropriate access is maintained


Contribute to consumer and pet privacy frameworks, terms, consents and approaches to ensure we position ourselves to empower consumers, to leverage effectively data for their advantage, to abide by all laws and relevant best practices


Drive Master Data Management collaboration and standards, and provide leadership in key areas of consumer- and pet-oriented data




Connect and collaborate effectively across Petcare to ensure our efforts are consistent, complementary and enable ecosystem benefits that are greater than the sum of the parts




Role model the ecosystem approach within the Division


Ensure the Division is contributing to the ecosystem data asset and best practices and supporting the needs other divisions might have to power their businesses


Develop and champion Pet and Pet Parent centric approaches even where consumer choices or pet needs might prioritize a different Division's solution above yours


Lead Division contribution to the broader Petcare strategies and governance of our Powered by Data efforts
